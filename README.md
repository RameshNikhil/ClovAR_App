## Our hackthon project built in flutter!
Our team recognises the decreasing number of children exploring their gardens and communities like we did when we were young. We also recognise that if given the opportunity and encouragement, kids will go out and try to learn about the wonderful exhibition of plants, trees and shrub their environments and we think this is a wonderful experience.

ClovAR ~ wherein four leaf clovers are by some of the rarest of flora, and AR where we have implemented Augmented Reality into our innovation ~ provides a gamified platform for people of all ages to leave their often garrisoned lives to take time out in nature.

The benefits of spending time in green, unprocessed, agrarian environments have been specified uncountable times in scientific literature and ClovAR gives users the excuse for people to enjoy these prosperities.
